**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

## Notes

- Specification derived from detailed UX wireframes document
- This is a refinement of the existing 005-service-definition-editor spec
- Key change from previous spec: explicit save per card (not auto-save)
- All user stories are independently testable
- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
