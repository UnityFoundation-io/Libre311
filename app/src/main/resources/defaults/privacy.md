# Privacy Policy
Last Updated on Dec 12, 2025

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy outlines the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of your information when you access and use Libre311. Your privacy is crucial to us, and we are committed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of the information you provide. By using Libre311, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of any updates or changes to this policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, do not use Libre311.

## Information We Collect
### Service Requests
Users may voluntarily provide service requests that identify specific issues or concerns within their community.

### Location Data
If the user enables GPS capture on their device, it will be used as the default location for service requests. Users may voluntarily select an alternate location on the map where they would like their service requests to appear.

### Time Data
We collect the time that a user’s service request is submitted. This is so that we can organize user requests chronologically in our database.

## Use of Information
We use the information collected to:

- Process and route service requests to appropriate municipal departments
- Track request status and resolution
- Analyze geographic patterns of reported issues to identify infrastructure needs and service gaps
- Generate reports and metrics for municipal planning and resource allocation
- Communicate with users about the status of their requests

## Data Retention
Service Requests, Location and Time Data are stored indefinitely in our database unless a user requests removal of their content through the process outlined above. We will continually review our data retention practices to ensure they align with our mission and legal obligations.

## Disclosure of Information
### Anonymity
Users contribute anonymously by default, so no usernames, passwords, phone numbers, email addresses or social media handles are associated with contributions unless the user explicitly provides them. This data will only be used by jurisdiction administrators and will not be exposed to the public.
### Legal Compliance
We may disclose information in response to legal processes or when required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or government requests.

## Third-Party Services
Libre311 may use third-party services for analytics, hosting, and other functionalities. These services may have their own privacy policies, and users are encouraged to review them.

### Security
We implement reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration. However, no data transmission over the internet is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Children’s Privacy
Libre311 is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect information from individuals under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Privacy Policy on the platform.
