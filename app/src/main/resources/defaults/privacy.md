## 1. Who we are and what this covers
This Privacy Policy explains how **Object Computing, Inc.** (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the **Libre311** community issue‑reporting application (the “Services”).

## 2. Our privacy principles
We are guided by these principles:

Depending on how the Services are configured:
